Yo :)

So I've created the unity project and put it up. I've also created three seperate scenes where we each can work on what we need to do

Just for ease of prototyping and development made a basic movement script (adapt it or change it how you like) and a basic platform prefab

If theres anything else. Shoot me a message and we can go from there :D
